Network Procurement Review Flow (M6.2) with incoming review queue (`NetworkSupplyRequestsReviewScreen`), approval decision dialog with automated invoicing (`approveRequest`), and rejection decision dialog with mandatory reason (`rejectRequest`). Detailed request inspection view (`ProcurementRequestDetailsScreen`) with items breakdown and server-calculated totals. Clean Architecture 3-layer strictly enforced, zero `StatefulWidget`/`setState`, zero direct HTTP calls, zero currency symbols/labels (`AmountFormatter.format`), full test suite passing (201/201 tests, 100%), static analysis clean (0 issues). |
| **Milestone 7:** Invoicing & Accounting | `COMPLETED & VERIFIED` | Fully delivered and verified across Flutter: Network Wholesale Invoices (M7.1) with cursor pagination, debounced search (300ms), sale type filtering, and network selector. POS Purchase Invoices (M7.2) with cursor pagination and purchase history. Invoice Details View (`InvoiceDetailsScreen`) with itemized breakdown table, authoritative server-calculated financial totals, and direct navigation to related procurement requests. Official Invoice Document Generation (`InvoiceDocumentService`): PDF export via `FileExportService`, direct printing via `Printing.layoutPdf`, and system sharing via `shareBytes`, with RTL Arabic support (IBM Plex Sans Arabic fonts). Zero `StatefulWidget`/`setState`, zero currency symbols (`AmountFormatter.format`), full test suite passing (210/210 tests, 100%), static analysis clean (0 issues). |
| **Milestone 8:** Wallets, Credit, Debts & Repayments | `NOT STARTED` | Scheduled after Milestone 7 completion & approval. |

## 2. Git Authority References

- **`netsales_api` (Laravel Backend):**
  - Branch: `main` (tracking `origin/main`)
  - Working Tree: Preserved. Zero destructive git operations.
- **`netsales` (Flutter Client):**
  - Branch: `main` (tracking `origin/main`)
  - Working Tree: Preserved. All user-supplied modifications retained.

## 3. Pending Decisions Register

All architectural and business decisions requiring future implementation approval remain strictly tracked:

- **`DEC-01` (`PROPOSED`):** Add `role_scope` to `AuthService::me()` response.
- **`DEC-02` (`PROPOSED`):** Seed dedicated least-privilege permission matrix for `NETWORK_ACCOUNTANT` and `POS_ACCOUNTANT`.
- **`DEC-03` (`PROPOSED`):** Enforce `PaymentType` enum validation and model casting in repayment settlement.
- **`DEC-04` (`PROPOSED`):** Implement informational server-side FIFO repayment preview endpoint (`POST /pos-debts/repayments/preview`).

---

## 4. Known Project Limitations & Verification Status

1. **Active Workspace Context Boundary (DEC-01):** Active tenant and workspace context switching remains bounded by DEC-01 (`PROPOSED`). Current backend isolates tenants strictly at the route policy and membership level (`NetworkWalletPolicy`, `PosWalletPolicy`, `NetworkMembershipService`), without a global tenant-context header.
2. **Registered Device Binding Limitation:** Registered device UUID is checked against the session association as a supplementary server-side security control. It is not cryptographic hardware attestation or absolute protection against device cloning.
3. **Client-Side Credential Storage:** Raw session tokens are returned once upon authentication and persisted securely on the client in `FlutterSecureStorage`. Raw tokens are never stored in the database or written to logs.
4. **Visual QA Status:** Visual QA for live rendered UI is marked **NOT VERIFIED — REQUIRES ACTIVE EMULATOR/DEVICE** due to zero running emulators during automated headless runs.
5. **Laravel Test Suite Failures:** 3 unrelated-scope failures; pre-existing status not established. (Failures in `Milestone4CConcurrencyAndDirectInvoiceDebtTest`, `NetworkRequestReviewAndApprovalTest`, and `VoucherRequestAndInvoicingTest` pertain to Phase 4 commercial and financial calculations outside Milestone 3).

## 5. Next Authorized Action
Halt at the Milestone 6 completion boundary. Present delivery verification evidence and await explicit user authorization before starting **Milestone 7 (Invoicing & Accounting)**.

## Active implementation — Network/POS membership safety (2026-11-09)
- API implementation is under review in PR #10 (`feat/scoped-membership-role-safety`).
- Flutter implementation is under review in NetSales PR #20 (`feat/network-pos-team-management`).
- Role assignment is intentionally limited to the ordinary operational user role per tenant. Accountant assignment remains excluded until accountant permission sets are verified to be read-only and policy-compliant.
- PR #20 depends on the API contract and `is_owner` response change in PR #10; merge the API PR first, then the Flutter PR.
- CI and visual QA are pending; do not mark this feature fully verified until exact-head checks pass and rendered phone/tablet Light/Dark review is completed.


## Active implementation — SaaS Billing and Versioned Trial/Dunning Policies (2026-11-10)
- Active backend branch: `feat/saas-billing-multicurrency-rebuild`.
- The subscription and billing domain is being rebuilt around immutable plan/price versions, explicit currencies, invoice/payment/ledger workflows, entitlements, usage metering, and platform-only billing administration.
- Trial behavior is controlled by versioned `billing_trial_policies` / `billing_trial_policy_versions`, not `system_settings`. Resolution order: price override → plan-version assignment → platform default.
- Trial eligibility, redemption uniqueness, manual approval, first-activation start, expiry behavior, and audited adjustments are server-owned.
- Grace periods, dunning reminders, auto-suspension, and pre-renewal alerts are separately governed by versioned dunning policies.
- `system_settings` no longer owns the `SUBSCRIPTION` category or its four legacy keys. The System Settings API rejects attempts to recreate the retired category.
- Existing plan versions are migrated to equivalent immutable trial policy versions; plans with zero trial days remain non-trial.
- Tests and GitHub Actions are intentionally deferred until the end of the approved implementation plan. No test or CI success is claimed in this state entry.


### Billing integration hardening — 2026-11-10
- Platform default trial is intentionally disabled; trial activation must be explicitly configured.
- Existing non-zero legacy plan trial durations map to dedicated policy versions. Existing subscriptions receive policy snapshots during migration.
- Ineligible trial customers may still purchase the paid subscription without a trial.
- First-activation trials use RESERVED redemption state and activate atomically on the first entitlement lookup after any required manual approval.
- Trial expiry behavior is enforced: EXPIRE closes the trial; CREATE_INVOICE begins conversion billing.
- Billing reminders are delivered through the existing notification service from Outbox with a unique message UUID delivery guard.
- Manual trial approval/rejection and audited trial adjustment routes are exposed under Platform Scope.
- Automated tests, migration execution, and GitHub Actions remain pending by user instruction.


### Billing lifecycle consistency — 2026-11-10
- Invoice reminders and grace-period deadlines are now anchored to contractual invoice due dates.
- Cancellation scheduling is limited to live subscriptions with a future period; pending renewal alerts are cancelled on cancellation.
- Payment verification now uses the global Invoice -> Payment -> Treasury lock order.
- A late settlement of an initially expired invoice can restore the subscription only by starting a fresh paid period if the original period elapsed.
- The duplicate payment idempotency-key migration operation has been removed.
- Automated validation and migrations remain pending by instruction.
